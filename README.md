# Django + Flutter = Djangoflow

Djangoflow is an open source framework created by [Apexive](https://apexive.com "Top-notch software development for startups. In weeks, not months.")
that uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for cross-platform apps and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com "Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design") for backend.

We also use [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/dart/) to automate the api client generation and save time and avoid human errors following [DRY](https://apexive.com/post/zero-technical-debt) principles.
